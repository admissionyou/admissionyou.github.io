<div id="ser"><b>SAT and ACT Prep</b></div><p id="colvis">
We provide preparation for the SAT and ACT and also can recommend groups or individuals who can help your student achieve his/her best possible score.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="ser"><b>College Visits</b></div><p>
Visits are an important first step in the college process and should begin Junior year. College visits help the student figure out the kind of school that best fits his/her personality. Is the student interested in a college that is big or small, urban or college town, close-to-home or far away? Visits also allow the student to envision a future in college that could later provide the enthusiasm needed to begin the application.  Students don't need to visit every college they're interested in attending, but they need to see enough of them to give them a sense of what they are looking for. We'll help plan visits, and when needed, escort the student to the college or university.</p></div>

<div class="containercolcho"><a><b>College Choice</b></a><p id="colcho">
<br>
Our in depth conversations with your student help us offer solid advice with college selection. We talk about grades, SAT/ACT scores, and future career goals. We also discuss hopes and fears about campus life to ascertain the size and style of school that would best fit the student's personality and geographic preference. Finally, since cost is always a factor, we consider the likelihood of a college offering scholarships. If there's interest and the student appears to be a good candidate, we will explore types of scholarships that could be available. We will then provide a list of safety and reach schools that complement both the student's character as well as his/her career aspirations. This comprehensive list of matching colleges and universities includes each school's average GPA and SAT/ACT scores, number of students, and type of admission accepted&mdash;early action, early decision, regular action and Ivy action&mdash;with corresponding deadlines, essays required, and request for letters of recommendation.</p></div>
<br>
<div id="ser"><b>College Applications</b></div><p id="colapp">
We'll help your student navigate the application process: Common Application, Coalition Application, and College/University Application. Based on the student's college choices, we personalize the information by school and action deadlines. We guide the student through the application questions and prepare them for any extra, college-specific writing prompts.</p>
<br>
<div id="ser"><b>Application Essays</b></div><p id="appess">
We brainstorm with the student to develop compelling essay ideas and then help and encourage the student through the writing process. College essays should reflect the personality of the student and although we coach the student on technique and voice, the student writes the essay. We edit the essays but never change the essays so much that the student's voice is no longer heard. Through the process, we keep in close contact to keep the student on track and on schedule.</p>
